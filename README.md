Python implementation of the famous french card game the "1000 bornes"

CODE AND REPORT ARE IN FRENCH !

As part of my Python programming class, we had to implement a french card game called "1000 bornes". 

One at a time, each player try to stack up *distance* card with values of 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200. The goal is to reach a cumulated distance of 1000, *bornes* being a french slang for milestones. What makes this game so entertaining is that one player can be slowdown by the others. There are in fact few attack cards such as *red traffic light* or *flat tire* which can slowdown or even stop one player; the only way to recover from these attack is to play the related defense card.
